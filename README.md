# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

**Project Goals:**
- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
- Deepen understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
- Implement advanced security measures for API development.
- Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
- Strengthen ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
- Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

**Tech Stack:**
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- GraphQL
- Docker
- GitHub Actions

## Team Roles
- **Backend Developer:** Responsible for designing and implementing the server-side logic, APIs, and database interactions. Ensures the application’s core functionality is robust and efficient.
- **Database Administrator:** Manages the database schema, ensures data integrity, and optimizes queries for performance. Maintains the reliability and scalability of data storage.
- **Frontend Developer:** Handles the client-side interface, ensuring a seamless user experience and integration with backend services. Focuses on usability and responsiveness.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Sets up and maintains the CI/CD pipelines, manages deployment, and ensures the application's scalability and reliability. Streamlines the development-to-production process.
- **QA Engineer:** Tests the application to identify and report bugs, ensuring the software meets quality standards. Guarantees a polished and error-free user experience.

## Technology Stack
- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building RESTful APIs and handling backend logic. It provides a rapid development environment with built-in security features.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system for storing and managing data. It offers advanced features like ACID compliance and scalability for complex queries.
- **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs, providing a more efficient and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
- **Docker:** A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, ensuring consistency across different environments. It simplifies deployment and scaling.
- **GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD tool for automating workflows, including testing, building, and deploying the application. It enhances development efficiency and code quality.

## Database Design
- **Users:** 
  - Fields: `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `role`
  - Relationships: Can own multiple properties, make bookings, and leave reviews.
- **Properties:** 
  - Fields: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`
  - Relationships: Owned by a user, can have multiple bookings and reviews.
- **Bookings:** 
  - Fields: `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`
  - Relationships: Belongs to a property and a user.
- **Reviews:** 
  - Fields: `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  - Relationships: Belongs to a property and a user.
- **Payments:** 
  - Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`
  - Relationships: Belongs to a booking.

## Feature Breakdown
- **User Management:** Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures personalization and secures user access to the platform.
- **Property Management:** Enables property owners to list, update, and manage their properties. It forms the backbone of the platform by facilitating property listings and availability.
- **Booking System:** Facilitates the booking of properties by users, including date selection and payment processing. This is central to delivering a seamless reservation experience.
- **Review System:** Allows users to leave reviews and ratings for properties, enhancing trust and decision-making. It builds community credibility and improves service quality.
- **Payment Processing:** Handles secure payment transactions for bookings, ensuring financial integrity. It provides a reliable and safe method for completing reservations.

## API Security
- **Authentication:** Ensures that only authorized users can access certain endpoints, protecting user data. This is critical for maintaining privacy and trust.
- **Authorization:** Controls access levels, allowing different permissions for different user roles. It ensures users only interact with resources they’re permitted to access.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame. This safeguards the system from overload and malicious attacks.
- **Data Encryption:** Secures sensitive data, such as payment information, during transmission and storage. It’s vital for protecting financial transactions and user information.
- **Input Validation:** Protects against injection attacks by validating and sanitizing user inputs. This prevents security vulnerabilities and ensures data integrity.

## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD pipelines automate the software development lifecycle, from code integration to deployment. They are essential for maintaining code quality, reducing manual errors, and accelerating the release process. For this project, tools like **GitHub Actions** can automate testing, building, and deployment workflows, while **Docker** ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages.
